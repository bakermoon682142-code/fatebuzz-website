# PRIVACY POLICY

**Last updated: [Date]**

This Privacy Policy describes how  we handle information in connection with the  **FateBuzz**  mobile application (the "App").

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. No Personal Information Collected

We do not require you to create an account or provide any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address to use the App. We do not have a user system and do not store any identifying personal data on our servers.

### 2. Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data)

To improve the user experience and maintain the App's performance, we use third-party tools (Google Firebase) to collect non-identifying information about how you interact with the App. This includes:

-   **Action Logs:**  Clicks on buttons, screen views, and time spent on specific features.
    
-   **Device Information:**  Device model, operating system version, and basic system performance data (e.g., crash logs).
    
-   **Identifiers:**  For advertising purposes, we may access your device’s  **Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)**, subject to your permission via the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.
    

### 3. Third-Party Service Providers

We work with third-party service providers to power our analytics and advertising. These providers may collect, monitor, and analyze data on our behalf:

-   **Google Firebase (Analytics):**  Used to understand user behavior and improve App functionality.
    
    -   [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
        
-   **Advertising Networks (e.g., Google AdMob, AppLovin, etc.):**  Used to display advertisements to monetize the App. These SDKs may collect data such as your IP address and IDFA to show relevant ads.
    
    -   _Note: Please check the privacy policy of the specific Ad SDKs you have integrated._
        

### 4. Advertising and Tracking

The App displays advertisements to remain free for users.

-   **App Tracking Transparency (ATT):**  On iOS, we will ask for your permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. If you decline, we will not access your IDFA, and you will see "non-personalized" ads that are less relevant to you.
    
-   **Personalized Ads:**  If you grant permission, third-party advertisers may use identifiers to serve ads based on your interests.
    

### 5. Children’s Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

### 6. Data Security

We prioritize the security of the data we collect. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately once posted on this page.
