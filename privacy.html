<p>This Privacy Policy describes how  we handle information in connection with the  <strong>FateBuzz</strong>  mobile application (the &quot;App&quot;).</p>
<p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
<h3 id="1-no-personal-information-collected">1. No Personal Information Collected</h3>
<p>We do not require you to create an account or provide any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address to use the App. We do not have a user system and do not store any identifying personal data on our servers.</p>
<h3 id="2-information-collected-automatically-usage-data-">2. Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data)</h3>
<p>To improve the user experience and maintain the App&#39;s performance, we use third-party tools (Google Firebase) to collect non-identifying information about how you interact with the App. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action Logs:</strong>  Clicks on buttons, screen views, and time spent on specific features.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Device Information:</strong>  Device model, operating system version, and basic system performance data (e.g., crash logs).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Identifiers:</strong>  For advertising purposes, we may access your device’s  <strong>Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)</strong>, subject to your permission via the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-third-party-service-providers">3. Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
<p>We work with third-party service providers to power our analytics and advertising. These providers may collect, monitor, and analyze data on our behalf:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Google Firebase (Analytics):</strong>  Used to understand user behavior and improve App functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a></li>

<h3 id="4-advertising-and-tracking">4. Advertising and Tracking</h3>
<p>The App displays advertisements to remain free for users.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong>  On iOS, we will ask for your permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. If you decline, we will not access your IDFA, and you will see &quot;non-personalized&quot; ads that are less relevant to you.</p>

<li><p><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong>  If you grant permission, third-party advertisers may use identifiers to serve ads based on your interests.</p>
